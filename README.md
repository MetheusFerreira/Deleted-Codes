# Deleted-Codes
Place to save all codes i couldn't use but liked anyway.


Player_Things_I_Forgot
{
  Used some of this on my player script, but it just happened to contain things I would not use under any circunstance. So, I had to delete.
  (maybe I'll explain what especific sections of the code can do, but then again, I forgorðŸ’€)
}
